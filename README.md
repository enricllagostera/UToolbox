# UToolbox

This project hosts a series of C# scripts and other facilities to help out in Unity projects. Also included are tests for each feature. I've started this project to speed up development of prototypes and to make sure I re-use my own code in a more structured way, making sure it is bug free and carefully written.

This is not meant to be a ready-made monolithic tool pack, just a gathering point for a series of things that can each be included in your own project as needed. Each feature uses very few scripts and is made to have small dependencies and coupling.

## What's in the box?

## Wish-list

- A generic `ConditionalWeightedBag` (inspired by [Reigns' procedural card system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDdtbh-oUTU&t=2s)) system to use with any sort of game element, which allows for highly flexible and controllable random draws.
- A simple `SpriteFader`, including alpha fades and dissolves controlled by a texture, to use with transitions and as a generic visual effect.
