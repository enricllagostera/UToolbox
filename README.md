# UToolbox

This project hosts a series of small scripts and facilities to help out in Unity3D projects. Also included are tests for each feature. I've started this project to speed up development of prototypes and to make sure I re-use my own code in a more structured way, making sure it is bug free and carefully written. This is not meant to be a pre-made tool pack, just a gathering point for a series of things that can each be included in your own project as needed.

## Tools in the box

- A generic `ConditionalWeightedBag` (inspired by [Reigns' procedural card system]()) data-structure to use with any sort of game element.
- A simple `SpriteFader`, including alpha fades and dissolves controlled by a texture, to use with transitions and as a generic visual effect.
